# Camera Extrinsics Example
# Camera-to-body transform for downward-facing camera

# Rotation matrix from camera frame to body frame
# Assumes camera looks straight down
rotation_matrix:
  - [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]

# Translation from body origin to camera origin (meters)
translation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.05]

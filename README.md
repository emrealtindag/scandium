## Overview

**Scandium** is a production-grade precision landing system designed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and multirotor platforms. The system operates as companion computer software that enables autonomous precision landing on fiducial markers (ArUco/AprilTag) by publishing MAVLink `LANDING_TARGET` messages to compatible autopilot systems including PX4 and ArduPilot.

This software package addresses the critical requirement for high-accuracy landing capabilities in scenarios where GNSS-based positioning proves insufficient, including indoor environments, GNSS-denied regions, and applications demanding sub-meter landing precision.

## Key Capabilities

### Fiducial Marker Detection
Multi-backend fiducial marker detection system supporting both ArUco (OpenCV) and AprilTag marker families. The detection pipeline incorporates configurable dictionary selection, marker size specification, and target ID allowlisting for operational security.

### Pose Estimation
Camera-to-body frame coordinate transformation system utilizing Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithms with temporal filtering. The estimation pipeline produces both position-based (x, y, z) and angle-based (angle_x, angle_y) outputs compatible with MAVLink LANDING_TARGET protocol specifications.

### MAVLink Integration
Native MAVLink protocol implementation for LANDING_TARGET message publishing. The system supports both UDP and serial transport layers, configurable publishing rates (10-50 Hz), and compatibility with PX4 and ArduPilot precision landing subsystems.

### Landability Analysis
Computer vision-based landing zone safety assessment system. The analysis incorporates texture variance evaluation, motion detection, edge density analysis, and optional machine learning-based segmentation for obstacle and human presence detection.

### Finite State Machine Control
Deterministic state machine implementation managing the complete landing sequence: INIT, IDLE, SEARCH, ACQUIRE, ALIGN, DESCEND, TOUCHDOWN, ABORT, and FAILSAFE states. State transitions are governed by configurable thresholds and safety constraints.

### Simulation Integration
Comprehensive simulation environment support including Microsoft AirSim and Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) configurations for both ArduPilot and PX4. Scenario-based testing framework enables systematic validation across diverse environmental conditions.

## Safety and Compliance

> **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**
>
> This software is designed exclusively for flight safety, safe recovery, automatic landing, and operational reliability applications. The system is intended for civilian and commercial UAV operations including but not limited to: infrastructure inspection, agricultural monitoring, search and rescue support, and logistics delivery.
>
> This software does not contain, and must not be modified to include, functionality for weaponization, target engagement, munitions guidance, or any harmful purposes. Any such modification would constitute a violation of the intended use and the terms of the Apache 2.0 license under which this software is distributed.

### Operational Safety Features

- **Fail-safe by default**: Uncertainty escalation triggers conservative behavior
- **No single point of failure**: Camera or MAVLink loss triggers autopilot fallback
- **Human safety priority**: Landability analysis aborts landing upon human detection
- **Anti-spoofing measures**: Tag allowlisting, size consistency validation, reprojection error thresholds
